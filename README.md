# Capstone-Frontend
Frontend Portion of the UMKC Capstone Project

## Requirements
- Node Installation

## Steps
- Confirm OAuth2 Configuration
- Confirm Backend Configuration
- Start Frontend

## OAuth2 Configuration
The frontend uses OAuth2 via PKCE to authenticate users. It uses OAuth hosted at https://sso.ynlueke.com. Changing or updating this is out of scope for this document.

## Backend Configuration
To change the backend host update the link in ./src/axios.js. If using a local host of the backend the link is most likly `http://localhost:5160` for dotnet SDK, or `http://localhost:5180` for docker.

## Starting the Frontend
The frontend can be run locally via Node or Docker

### Node
- Install Node Packages `npm install`
- Start App `npm start`

### Docker
- Build Docker Image `docker build -t frontend-image -f Dockerfile .`
- Start docker Container `docker run --name frontend -p 4000:4000 frontend-image`

# Getting Started with Frontend React App React Generated Readme

## Getting Started

You must have a version of node installed. I recommend `nvm` so you are able to develop 
on multiple node versions.

Once node is installed test your installation with the following commands

`node -v` 
-> `v20.10.0`
`npm -v`
-> `10.2.5`

After the node & npm version has been confirmed 
run `npm ci`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
